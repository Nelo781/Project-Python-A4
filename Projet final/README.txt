this project takes place for the Python Course Final Project of the DIA degree 2020/2021.

This is a classification project in python based on the Avila Bible Dataset. The
purpose is to predict the copysist for each of the 10429 Avila Bible samples,
depending on the several features contained in the dataset for each sample.

The data is divided in 2 set: 

You can find the Python Notebook in wich we used scikit learn classifiers for
classication and seaborn for visualization.
We trained several classification methods as:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Grid Search: Random Forest
We also used the scikit learn confusion matrix, accuracy score and cross-validation
to dertermine the most accurate method(s) for this classification project.
