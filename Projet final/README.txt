Identify copyist of “Avila Bible” with Supervised Learning

This project takes place for the Python Course Final Project of the ESILV DIA degree 2020/2021.


This is a classification project in python based on the Avila Bible Dataset. The
purpose is to predict the copysist for each of the 10429 Avila Bible samples,
depending on the several features contained in the dataset for each sample.

The data is divided in 2 set: avila_tr the training set used for fitting the classifiers
and the avila_ts, the test set used for validation.

You can find the Python Notebook in wich we used scikit learn classifiers for
classication and seaborn for visualization.

We trained several classification methods as:
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Grid Search: Random Forest
  
We also used the scikit learn confusion matrix, accuracy score and cross-validation
to dertermine the most accurate method(s) for this classification project.

We attached to this repositorie the report of our work explaining our quest 
of accuracy.
